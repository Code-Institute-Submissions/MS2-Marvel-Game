# Marvel Games Website

The website is based on the Marvel comics universe. As a fan of the Marvel universe, I wanted to base my site on this.
There are two games that users can play. They are:

1) A turn based battle game. Play as Spiderman and use his abilities to defeat his nemesis, Green Goblin. 
2) Card pair matching game. There are a total of 12 Marvel characters. Find and pair up the heroes within the time limit.

# User Experience (UX)

## User Stories

As a visitor and a user of the website, I would like to:

* Play and experience a battle/fighting game using a Marvel Hero. 
* Fight a difficult battle against a Marvel villain.
* See how effective the abilities I select in defeating the enemy.
* View the abilities used by the opponent.
* Play a card matching game to challenge my memory.
* Adjust the music and sound settings at any time.
* Understand the games that I play with clear instructions.

## Design

- Colour Scheme
    - For the page headings, I used red for the home page, and blue background for both Battle and Card Matching pages as well as a white font. This was to keep in line with the official Marvel logo.
    - All font colours are white, again to stick with the Marvel logo theme.
    - My modals are dark blue.
    - The background which sits in front of the back-most background is burgandy. This is applied on both Card Matching and Battle pages.
    - Orange is used for the exit button, to highlight how to return to the main page.
    - Purple is used for the audio settings button.
    - The buttons for the Battle page are black and white, this gave a classic comic book feel to them.

- Typography
    - The 'Anton' font is used throughout the whole website. This appeared to go well with the official Marvel logo font as well gave a comic book feel. 'Sans Serif' is used as a back up should the 'Anton' font fails to load.

- Wireframes
    
    The design for the wireframes were created using Balsamiq. Links for these are found below.
